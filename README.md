# Tone Shifter Agent

A GenAI-powered bilingual agent that translates between English and Chinese with attention to emotional nuance, tone, and idiomatic expression.  
Inspired by real-world cross-cultural conversations â€” especially on Gen Z social media and in casual messaging â€” this agent aims to preserve emotion and intention across languages.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Project Overview

This agent helps users translate sensitive or socially complex messages (such as polite refusals, soft encouragements, indirect expressions) while preserving the intended emotional effect.

## ðŸ§  Prompt Strategy

The agent is instructed to:

- Avoid robotic or literal translations  
- Preserve tone, intention, and implied meanings  
- Handle indirect requests, refusals, and idioms  

See [`prompt.txt`](./prompt.txt) for the full system instruction.

## ðŸ§ª Examples

Example test cases with original input and translated output can be found in [`example_cases.md`](./example_cases.md).
